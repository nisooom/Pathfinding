Pathfinding Algorithm Implementation with A*
---
Using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and RayGui, I have implemented a basic A* implementation, 
<br>
It allows the user to choose whether to use diagonals or not in the calculation of the area.

> In a worst-case, the algorithm can be O(b^d), where b is the branching factor â€“ the average number of edges from each node, and d is the number of nodes on the resulting path

User can also change the variables and colors used in the implementation by changing some parts of the code


```c
// Lines 13-35
#define WIDTH 720
#define WIN_HEIGHT WIDTH
#define WIN_WIDTH (WIDTH + WIDTH * 0.3)
#define ROWS (int)(WIDTH/20)
#define FPS 60

Color baseTileColor = DARKBLUE;
Color startColor = WHITE;
Color goalColor = PINK;
Color endingColor = WHITE;
Color gridLineColor = BLACK;
Color barrierColor = BLACK;
Color pathColor = RED;
Color visitedColor = ORANGE;

```

For now,

running the code, you will require CMake as it has external dependencies.

Next Release will have all libraries added to the include folder for now only RayGui is added
